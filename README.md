# MNIST .Net
A MNIST test program using .net ML machine learning library

## Framework
This project using .NET Core 2.1 for training and testing, and give a GUI client to test which written with .NET Framework 4.7.2 and WPF.

## Best learning score
![Best score screenshot](http://t.w2wz.cn/t6/700/1555002414x2059272782.png)
Using 60000 training samples and 10000 testing samples.

Using SDCA maximum entropy multiclass trainer.

Training on Surface Go /w Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU 4415Y @1.6GHz at Visual Studio 2019 debugging mode.

## MNIST Dataset
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

This project is using the MNIST dataset from [MNIST offical homepage](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## ML.net
ML.NET is a machine learning framework built for .NET developers.

It can let us use our .NET and C# or F# skills to easily integrate custom machine learning into your applications without any prior expertise in developing or tuning machine learning models.

Visit [Microsoft ML.net offical homepage](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) for more information.

This project using ML.net version 1.0.0-preview
